'I' stands for 'integrated,' and refers to the differencing of data values by replacing them with the difference between current and prior values.  And finally, 'MA' stands for 'moving average,' which considers an average that is continually calculated and recalculated over a set period of time in the past, like the average of a data point over the last 30 days, for example."
